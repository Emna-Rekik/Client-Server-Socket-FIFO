# Client-Server-with-Socket

This project is a continuation of the previous project titled "Client-Server-with-FIFO". However, this time, we will be using sockets to accomplish the same task. The main goal of this project is to develop a Server-Client application where the client requests some random numbers from the server. The server generates the response and sends it back to the client. Additionally, we will also be developing a graphical user interface that brings together both of these functionalities.
